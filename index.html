        <p> Starting out with the initial Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in 1999,[2] the series proved to be one of the most popular and best-selling video game franchises of the early 2000s. Three more Pro Skater games were released from 2000 to 2002, after which the developers took a more story-oriented approach with the releases of Underground, Underground 2 and American Wasteland from 2002 to 2005. Project 8 in 2006 and Proving Ground in 2007 were the last games in the series developed by Neversoft. This was my favorite game growing up and I loved to play it. I played it after school and I played it after basketball practice.

            <figcaption>FOUR-BILLION YEARS AGO, errant meteorites slammed into the lifeless lump of stone that is planet Earth, sprinkling their cosmic crud like so much dandruff and sparking what would eventually become Orlando, Florida (and the rest of life as we know it), though all of that took a hell of a lot of time. It was there that a young Evan Smith picked up a skateboard toy, his instant mastery of which leads us to believe that he`d somehow absorbed a little more than his fair share of that original space gunk.</figcaption>
